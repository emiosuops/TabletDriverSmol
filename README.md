1. ONLY FOR MY MODDED VMULTI SO FAR
2. HARDCODED DEVICE ID, HARDCODED AREA
3. EDITABLE WITHOUT RECOMPILATION
4. WIP
5. .exe will be configurable by editing it in notepad

all code fits in 1 page on disk and in ram (sub 4 kb)

lowest cpu usage of any osu tablet driver, perma 0.01% on 1core 11900k

lowest io usage of any osu tablet driver, perma 1.86-2.01kb/s

10 from tablet + 4 non-zero from vmulti = 1.93kb

100% efficiency apparently
